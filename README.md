## Improvements that can be done

- More regex search fieds can be added to cover more edge cases
- Some generic mechanism to identify similar keywords can be implementd 
- Some kind of user feedback can we taken (ie): Somewhat expected data and by that feedback more regex edge cases could be added.
- Currently the system uses pure regex to identify token in the questions, We can use some NLP libraries to do so.
